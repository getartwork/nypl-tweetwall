  annotation: It's 1963, a time in the United States when life was simple, straightforward
    and the lines between the sexes and sex roles were crisply drawn and severely
    delineated. Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist find themselves thrown together when
    they are hired to tend sheep in the remote area of Brokeback Mountain, Wyoming.
    Because of the job, the two are forced to spend many hours together alone in the
    wild. Ennis and Jack are inexorably drawn to each other through their proximity,
    loneliness and through a shared lack of tenderness and emotion in their lives
    and are emotionally, physically and psychically bonded to each other almost from
    the start.
